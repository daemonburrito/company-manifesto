Introduction

About this essay, the following could be said, by its original author. Others could, naturally, have different opinions; and, of course, it is an intentional property of this work to evolve.

Description
----
_The following document is, at once, a:_
* _A thought experiment, in which one constraint is removed and the organization of a new entity is proposed. Its legal classification is not formally specified; it could be an S-Corp, a 501(c\)(3) Ã  la Software in the Public Interest, etc.; perhaps even an entity which has not been specified statuatorily or even not yet imagined. The details are deliberately unspecified for our purposes._
* _An outline of guiding principles for the creation of such an entity; where no ethical compromises are, or could be, made, without changing the nature of thing itself._
* _An exploration of the limits in place in our society for entities of this type; others surely exist and bear similarilities: the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation and its corporate sibling, the Free Software Foundation/GNU, etc._

Purpose
----
This book is a product of most of a natural lifetime spent in an industry. To some, a wholly new and life-on-Earth-changing industry; to others, yet another outgrowth of creative writing and the science, with a dash of hubris.

The work's central focus is the total failure to introduce a new kind of management tailored for its unique features (that is does is up for debate, as hinted at).

What is most amusing is that the answers to many of the outstanding questions are known; the *answers* that some are seeking is where to make room for a class of professional which may no longer be necessary! This may be of the more cynical and controversial subjects of the essay; and I will be taking my time exploring it.

The issue, in as short a form as I can manage in an introduction, it that nearly all for-proft companies that I have worked-for/consulted-for have viewed itself (the company) as a sort of **customer** (this may take a moment to digest), and the software team as an internal vendor. Naturally, this implies that the software team is a loss center, whose costs must be minimized and examined within an inch of its life.

The protected class of which I speak has different names based on the methodology in use, in "Scrum", an off-shoot of Agile, the class is divided into two: "Product Manager" and "Project Manager". For many, complete ignorance of anything technical or, at least, any details of the project, is seen as a positive.

The "Product Manager" is meant to be the representative of the pretend "customer". This is an extremely dangerous situation when staffed by a skilled managerial hand; because, in effect, this personal can become the "off-paper" chief of the entire operation, even informally outranking the "project manager"
